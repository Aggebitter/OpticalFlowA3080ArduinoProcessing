# OpticalFlowA3080ArduinoProcessing

Hey Ho,

Arduino and Processing code for an A3080 or ADNS3080 optical flow sensor.

At first, get the Arduino code on your Arduino running. Then read the serial monitor on 38400 baud, to see if you get vector data in a stream.

Then you can try the Processing code. The only problem might occour at the serial port at line 16. Try different ports.

Best wishes,

Neumi
